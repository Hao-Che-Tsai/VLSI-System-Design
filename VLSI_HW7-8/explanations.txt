(1)The FSM Coverage isn't 100%. We've traversed all the states, yet there remain "2" unexplored FSM transitions, 
which are SUBT -> DONE, and SWAP -> DONE. Under ordinary circumstances, these transitions won't occur. 
The reason is that the FSM dictates that the subsequent state to SUBT or SWAP cannot be the DONE state. 
Instead, SUBT progresses to TEST and SWAP progresses to SUBT. 
Thus, it's appropriate that the report doesn't account for these two transitions.

However, there exists one particular situation that could accommodate these transitions: 
when the reset_n signal is deasserted while the current state is either SUBT or SWAP. In such a case, the subsequent state reverts to DONE. 
In conclusion, the inability to achieve 100% FSM coverage is attributed to unexpected behavior, not a design fault.

(2)Condition Coverage isn't discovered within the design files, which is considered a normal situation. 
This is because the design files do not comprise any condition, such as "==". All conditions are present in the testbench, 
but they aren't mandated to be covered as they are not part of the design files. Hence, I employ the "exclude" command in the .do file.
